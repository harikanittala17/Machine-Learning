1.LinearRegression.py

The main objective of the project linear regression is to implement linear regression model and understand how can we extend ordinary least squares regression, which uses the hypothesis class of linear regression functions, to non-linear regression functions modeled using polynomial basis functions and radial basis functions. The function we want to fit is y_true=6(sin(x+2)+sin(2*(x+4))) which is a univariate function as it has only one input variable.
